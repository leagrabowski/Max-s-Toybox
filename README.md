# This is my final project to my CMPSC-200 class, Virtual Worlds. We were given creative freedom to create a game of our very own. My game is base din a bedroom, and is first person orientated, the player is a toy Penguin. The goal of this game is to collect every toy in the room (by clicking) in 25 seconds, before Max gets home. If 25 seconds goes by and there is any toys left on the ground then Max will come home angry and the player loses. However if all the toys are collected before 25 seconds then Max immediately comes home happy and the player wins!

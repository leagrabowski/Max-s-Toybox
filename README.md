# Info
This is my final project to my CMPSC-200 class, Virtual Worlds. We were given creative freedom to create a game of our very own. My game is based in a bedroom, and is first person orientated, the player is a toy Penguin. The owner of these toys, Max, is a young boy who doesn't like a messy room.
# Goal
The goal of this game is to collect every toy in the room (by clicking) in 25 seconds, before Max gets home. The player can control themselves using WASD and arrow keys. If 25 seconds goes by and there is any toys left on the ground then Max will come home angry and the player loses. However if all the toys are collected before 25 seconds then Max immediately comes home happy and the player wins!
# IDE
I used Alice3 to create this program which is a great introduction into programming.
